# SW: Return of the team

# Story 

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was an application about Star 
Wars. This application allows you to create a team of Star Wars characters. 
These characters will be attributed random stats, like attack and defense. This 
highly qualified and trained team needs a base of operations, obviously. That's 
why you'll choose a planet where your base will be located. To get around on 
this planet you will need a plethora of vehicles. Your team will have the 
choice of their vehicles. Of course, no fighting team would be complete without
a starship! 

That's the gist of the application. With your composed team you will be able to 
attack random computer enemies and level up your characters. The higher your 
level, the more difficult the opponent. By destroying your enemies, you'll get 
access to more planets, characters and vehicles. 

**Become the new Empire!**
