    <string name="about_blurb1">A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was an application about Star Wars. This application allows you to create a team of Star Wars characters. These characters will be attributed random stats, like attack and defense. This highly qualified and trained team needs a base of operations, obviously. That\'s why you\'ll choose a planet where your base will be located. To get around on this planet you will need a plethora of vehicles. Your team will have the choice of their vehicles. Of course, no fighting team would be complete without a starship</string>
    <string name="about_blurb2">That\'s the gist of the application. With your composed team you will be able to attack random computer enemies and level up your characters. The higher your level, the more difficult the opponent. By destroying your enemies, you\'ll get access to more planets, characters and vehicles.</string>
